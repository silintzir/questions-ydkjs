# YDKJS Book 2: Types & Grammar
Questions coming from the 2nd Book, *"You don't know JS"*

## Chapter 1: Types

#### What are the built-in types supported by JavaScript?
`null`,`undefined`,`boolean`,`number`,`string`,`object`,`symbol`(added with ES6)

#### What are the primitive types of Javascript?
All types except `object` type are called *primitives*.

#### How to test for `null` value using its type?
Because of a bug existing for over two decades (and most likely never about to be fixed), `typeof` operator on a `null` value returns `"object"`. In order to test for a `null` value using its type, we need a compound condition:
	
	var a = null;
	(!a && typeof a === "object"); // true
	
#### What are the subtypes built-in Javascript?
`function` and `array` are built-in subtypes. `typeof` returns `"function"` and `object` respectively. 

#### What does the `typeof` operator returns when run on a non-declared variable?
it returns `"undefined"` as well which is kinda confusing.

## Chapter 2: Values

#### Name to ways to duplicate an array.
`slice()` when called without parameters duplicates an array. Also, as of ES6, a built-in utility called `Array.from()`, can be used to achieve the same thing.

#### If `string` type values can be considered as arrays of characters, what is the difference with arrays in regards to usage and methods allowed on them?
`string` type values are immutable while `array`s are mutable. As a consequence, none of the `string` methods that alter its contents can modify in-place, but rather must create a return new `string`s. By contrast, many of the methods that change `array` contents actually do modify in-place.

#### How do references work in JS?
A reference in JS points at a (shared) value, so if you have 10 different references, they are always distinct references to a single shared value; none of them are reference/pointers to each other. Moreover, in JS, there are no syntactic hints that control value vs. reference assignment/passing. Instead, the *type* of the value *solely* controls whether that value will be assigned by value-copy or by reference-copy.

#### What values are assigned/passed by value-copy and which by reference-copy in JS?
`null`, `undefined`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and ES6's `symbol` values are called *primitive* type values and are *always* assigned/passed by value-copy.

`object` (including `array` and all boxed object wrappers) and `function`s are called *compound* values and get *always* assigned/passed by reference-copy.

You cannot directly control/override value-copy vs. reference -- those semantics are controlled entirely by the type of the underlying value. To effectively pass a compound value (like an `array`) by value-copy, you need to manually make a copy of it, so that the reference passed doesn't still point to the original.

## Chapter 3: Natives

#### What are the *Natives* that JS supports?
Here's a list with the most commonly used Natives:

* `String()`
* `Number()`
* `Boolean()`
* `Array()`
* `Object()`
* `Function()`
* `RegExp()`
* `Date()`
* `Error()`
* `Symbol()` -- added in ES6!

#### What is the usefulness of *Boxing Wrappers*?
Primitive values in JS (`string`,`number`,`boolean`) don't have properties or methods, so to access `.length` or `.toString()` you need an object wrapper around the value. Thankfully, JS will automatically *box* (aka wrap) the primitive value to fullfill such accesses.

#### Does using a Boxing Wrapper optimizes even further calls to properies or methods like `.length` or `.toString()`?
No, actually you should never manually use Natives instead of primitives in your programs as the Engines long ago optimized the operation of such accesses, which means your program will actually go slower if you try to "preoptimize" by directly using the object form.

## Chapter 4: Coercion

#### How does coercion differs from type casting and what does JS support?
Converting a value from one type to another is often called *type casting* when done explicitly, and *coercion* when done implicitly (forced by the rules of how a value is used). Another way these terms are often distinguished is as follows: "type casting" (or "type conversion") occur in statically typed languages at compile time, while "type coercion" is a runtime conversion for dynamically typed languages. However, in JavaScript, most people refer to all these types of conversions as coercion, so the way I prefer to distinguish is to say "implicit coercion" vs. "explicit coercion."

**Note**: It may not be obvious, but JavaScript coercions always result in one of the scalar primitive (see Chapter 2) values, like `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. There is no coercion that results in a complex value like `object` or `function`.
